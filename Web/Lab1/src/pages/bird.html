            <h3>Toxic bird</h3>
            <p>
                Toxic birds are birds that use toxins to defend themselves from predators. No species of bird is known to actively inject or produce venom, but the discovered toxic birds are known to be poisonous to touch and eat. These birds usually sequester poison from animals and plants they feed on, especially poisonous insects. Birds with known toxic traits include the pitohui and ifrita birds from Papua New Guinea, the European quail, the spur-winged goose, hoopoes, the bronzewing pigeon, and the red warbler, among others.    
            </p>
            <p>
                The pitohui, the ifrita, and the rufous or little shrikethrush all sequester batrachotoxin in their skin and feathers. The African spur-winged goose is toxic to eat as it sequesters poison in its tissues, from the blister beetles that it feeds on. European quail are also known to be toxic and are able to cause coturnism at certain stages in their migrations.    
            </p>
            <h4>Initial research</h4>
            <p>
                The first research done on toxic birds was published in 1992 by Dumbacher et al., which found traces of the neurotoxin homobatrachotoxin, a steroid alkaloid with the ability to polarize Na+ channels, in the feathers and body tissue of many species of New Guinea passerine birds of the genus Pitohui and Ifrita. Before 1992, the toxins of the passerine birds of New Guinea had only been found in three species of poison dart frogs in Western Colombia (Phyllobates terribilis, Phyllobates bicolor, Phyllobates aurotaenia). Phyllobates kept in captivity do not develop the toxins, and the extent of the toxicity varies both in the pitohuis across their range. Both of these facts suggest that the toxins are obtained from diet. Toxic insects, primarily beetles, in the diets of these toxic birds are the most common sources for the bird’s toxicity. In the New Guinea bird species of Pitohui and Ifrita, the beetles of genus Choresine, natively known as nanisani, are pivotal food sources, and toxin sources, of these birds.
            </p>
            <h4>Use of toxins</h4>
            <p>
                Poison is the only form of toxic weaponry that has evolved within birds, and it appears to have been gained in particular independent clusters of avian lineages (e.g., Pitohui and Ifrita). These clusters appear near the tips of the phylogeny which, combined with the higher rate of loss than gain, suggests that many lineages have likely evolved the ability to sequester poisons through time, but have subsequently lost that ability. It is hypothesized that this chemical defence is effectively used against predators such as snakes, raptors, and some arboreal marsupials. It is also hypothesized that skin/feather toxicity is used as a defence against ectoparasites. Batrachotoxins have been found to be poisonous to distantly related orders of insects, which suggests that batrachotoxins may well be effective against a wide range of ectoparasite arthropods.
            </p>
            <p>
                These ectoparasites have been found to play a role in the reproduction of birds in the genus Pitohui and Ifrita, in which their presence on the host increases time and energy spent during reproduction periods. The development of batrachotoxin in toxic birds has led to an advantage of these birds against ectoparasites, as they deter parasites from finding sanctuary on bird body tissue and feathers with the toxin, which suggests ectoparasites to be an important evolutionary force in sexual selection.
            </p>
            <h4>Origins of batrachotoxins in birds</h4>
            <p>
                The search for batrachotoxins in organisms consumed by birds has yet to indicate an exogenous source. Stomach content studies reveal a variety of arthropods, mostly insects, and occasional fruits, but chemical analyses of these materials fail to reveal the presence of toxins. One can only speculate on sources of avian batrachotoxins if they are not synthesized de novo. The occurrence of batrachotoxins in muscle, viscera, and deep regions of the skin argues against these substances being topically applied, i.e., through “anting,” a behavior common in passerines where arthropods, fruits, or other materials are smeared directly onto the plumage. Perhaps birds sequester batrachotoxins produced by microorganisms in a way analogous to that in which pufferfish may obtain tetrodotoxin, another neurotoxin, from bacteria in their skin.

                    <p>
                        Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) ostrich. There are about ten thousand living species, more than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which are modified forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming.    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Birds are feathered theropod dinosaurs and constitute the only known living dinosaurs. Likewise, birds are considered reptiles in the modern cladistic sense of the term, and their closest living relatives are the crocodilians. Birds are descendants of the primitive avialans (whose members include Archaeopteryx) which first appeared about 160 million years ago (mya) in China. According to DNA evidence, modern birds (Neornithes) evolved in the Middle to Late Cretaceous, and diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 mya, which killed off the pterosaurs and all non-avian dinosaurs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture. Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and songs, and participating in such behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially (but not necessarily sexually) monogamous, usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, and rarely for life. Other species have breeding systems that are polygynous (one male with many females) or, rarely, polyandrous (one female with many males). Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual reproduction. They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many species of birds are economically important as food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing, with domesticated and undomesticated birds being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers. Songbirds, parrots, and other species are popular as pets. Guano (bird excrement) is harvested for use as a fertiliser. Birds figure throughout human culture. About 120 to 130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to protect them. Recreational birdwatching is an important part of the ecotourism industry.

                        <H2>The Biggest Birds In The World</H2>
                        <h3>Common Ostrich</h3>
                        <p>
                            What is the biggest bird in the world? No contest, the common ostrich (Struthio camelus) is the biggest bird in the world.

                            <br>It’s both the tallest and heaviest, with an average height of over 2 meters (sometimes as tall as 2.8 meters) and a weight of up to 160 kg. At this size, the ostrich is, of course, a flightless bird, but can outrun plenty of animals with its top speed of 69 km per hour, which makes it the fastest animal on two legs.

                            <br>Their long, powerful legs double up as defensive weapons which pack a powerful kick to would-be predators. Fun ostrich fact – they are able to survive without water for days, generating water internally and extracting water from vegetation.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Biggest bird in the world, by wingspan: Wandering Albatross</h3>
                        <p>
                            With a wingspan of up to 3.7 meters wide, the wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans) has the largest wingspan of any living bird on Earth. This enormous wingspan allows the albatross to glide for long distances without the need to flap their wings, which in turn helps define the wandering albatrosses lifestyle as birds which spend most of their lives in flight, landing only to breed and feed.    
                        </p>
                        <h3>Great Bustard – the heaviest flying bird in Europe</h3>
                        <p>
                            Great Bustard is the heaviest flying bird in Europe. This amazing bird can be spotted also very close to Bratislava. Large flocks in winter or mating display in spring could be the reason why to choose this trip.
                        
                            <br>Large flocks of wintering Great Bustards use to choose rapeseed stubble stands in the outskirts of Bratislava. Flat monotonous landscape covered with fields provide good refuge for this endangered species. Lowland sites with an outstanding agricultural management in southeastern Austria is the perfect place to witness unique mating display of Great Bustards. Wooden hides and platforms enable convenient access and observation. This slightly undulated landscape is also hunting ground of Short-eared Owl, Montagu’s Harrier or Imperial Eagle.
                        
                            <br>Great Bustard (Otis tarda) belongs to the heaviest flying birds in the world. Males could weight up to 22 kilograms. It has also large wingspan, that reaches almost 2,7 metres. Bustards usually inhabit open flat steppe or grasslands regions, but in Central Europe they live mostly in areas with agricultural landuse. Largest populations in Europe can be found in Spain. Its population in Central Europe is declining due to the intensification of agriculture and development of the net of roads and powerlines.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Andean condor</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Andean condor is the largest species of raptor on the planet and the second-largest wingspan of any bird — which spans around 10.5 feet (3.2 meters), according to the San Diego Wildlife Alliance(opens in new tab). Along with their impressive wingspan, these birds can ascend to heights of up to 18,000 feet (5,500 meters) passing over the peaks of the Andes, according to Welsh Mountain Zoo(opens in new tab). Due to their large wingspan, these birds can globe on air current with ease without expelling much energy. Andean condors are a species of vulture and like many vulture species, aren’t predominantly hunters and scavenge their food from dying or deceased animals. around 15 pounds (6.8 kilograms) of carrion (dead or decaying flesh) in a single meal, according to San Diego Wildlife Alliance. The Andean condor also has a long lifespan of around 50 years in the wild and up to 80 years while in captivity, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society Peru(opens in new tab).

                <H2>The Common Swift Is No Longer the Fastest-Flying Animal</H2>
                <p>
                    The Common Swift has officially lost its crown as the fastest-flying animal in the sky. So who took the title? The Peregrine Falcon? A frigatebird? Perhaps the Grey-headed Albatross? None of the above. The answer might surprise you, because according to the latest research, the fastest flier in the animal kingdom isn't a bird at all. It's a bat.     
                </p>
                <p>
                    But first, some background: The Peregrine Falcon is indisputably the fastest animal in the sky. It has been measured at speeds above 83.3 m/s (186 mph), but only when stooping, or diving. So for many years, it was commonly held by scientists that the fastest-flying bird in level flight was the White-throated Needletail (formerly known as the Spine-tailed Swift), which could supposedly reach speeds of up to 47m/s (105 mph). That number, however, had never been scientifically proven.     
                </p>
                <p>
                    It turns out that measuring the speed of animals in flight is actually fairly difficult, and it wasn’t until 2009 that a research team from Lund University in Sweden used high-speed cameras to scientifically measure what they believed to be the fastest flier on the planet, the Common Swift. At a scientifically verifiable 31m/s (69 mph), achieved during mating flights (also known as “screaming parties”), the swift was named the fastest pair of wings in the world. It held that title for seven years, but earlier this month scientists published a paper crowning a new fastest flier: the Brazilian free-tailed bat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The accepted knowledge about bats in flight is that because of a lower mass-to-wing-area ratio and a less aerodynamic body shape, they are slower but more maneuverable fliers than birds. Like the speed of the White-throated Needletail, this was one of those “facts” that had never actually been verified. By using a small airplane, tricky piloting, and some clever triangulation to follow bats tagged with radio transmitters, a research team was able to measure female bats flying at almost 45 m/s (99.5 mph), which is almost 50 percent faster than the Common Swift’s record. This was a surprising result for everyone, including the scientists performing the study, and we can likely expect to hear about a lot more research into bat flight characteristics in the near future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Swift fans (not this kind) disappointed at the dethroning of their champion can take solace in the fact that the Common Swift still holds the record for longest continuous flight. There is no indication that bats are anywhere close to taking that record from them anytime soon.
