            <h3>The most painful wasp sting in the world explained</h3>
            <p>
                Armed with one of the most painful stings on the planet, tarantula hawks are a spider's worst nightmare.

            <br>A fear of insects is common among humans, but for some spiders, stings really can be a matter of life or death. One wasp in particular makes even the biggest, hairiest spider run away in terror: the tarantula hawk.
                
            <br>Dr Gavin Broad, wasp expert at the Museum, uncovers the eccentricities of this small but sinister creature.    
            </p>
            <h4>Bird or spider?</h4>
            <p>
                Despite their name, tarantula hawks (Pepsis genus) are actually a species of spider wasp.<br> The largest species of tarantula hawk, Pepsis heros, will be going on display at the Museum in summer 2017.<br>  
                Reaching up to 11 centimetres in length, these insects lead solitary lives and their 133 known species are found across South and Central America and in the southern United States.<br>
                
                They are named after their habit of hunting tarantulas, which are often considerably larger than themselves - but these wasps do so with little risk to their own lives.<br>  
                
                'The wasps always win. I don't think anyone has ever seen a tarantula kill the wasp,' says Gavin.<br>
                
                'The spiders will usually try to flee or avoid them at all costs.'   
            </p>
            <h4>Frozen dinners</h4>
            <p>
                Adult tarantula hawks get their nutrition from nectar, but only the females will battle spiders to provide food for their offspring.
                <br>They pierce the tarantula with a sharp, curved sting, rapidly injecting venom that permanently paralyses but keeps its hairy adversary alive.

                <br>The incapacitated spider is either held captive in its own burrow or dragged to the wasp's nest. The female then lays a single egg on the spider's body.

                <br>The purpose of this act: a pre-prepared dinner.
                
                <br>When the egg hatches, the larva burrows its way inside the spider's abdomen and begins feasting on the still-living tarantula.
                
                <br>It begins by feeding on haemolymph - the spider equivalent of blood - before gorging itself on the tissue.
                
                <br>Eventually the offspring emerges from the spider as an adult tarantula hawk.
                
                <br>Gavin explains, 'The spider has got no chance. Even if you took the larva away, it wouldn't recover.'
                
                <br>'It would remain in a state of suspended animation for quite a while, until eventually its respiration would stop.'

                    <H2>Insects</H2>
                    <p>
                        Insects (from Latin insectum) are pancrustacean hexapod invertebrates of the class Insecta. They are the largest group within the arthropod phylum. Insects have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. Their blood is not totally contained in vessels; some circulates in an open cavity known as the haemocoel. Insects are the most diverse group of animals; they include more than a million described species and represent more than half of all known living organisms. The total number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million; potentially over 90% of the animal life forms on Earth are insects. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, which are dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans, which recent research has indicated insects are nested within.

                    <p>
                        Nearly all insects hatch from eggs. Insect growth is constrained by the inelastic exoskeleton and development involves a series of molts. The immature stages often differ from the adults in structure, habit and habitat, and can include a usually immobile pupal stage in those groups that undergo four-stage metamorphosis. Insects that undergo three-stage metamorphosis lack a pupal stage and adults develop through a series of nymphal stages. The higher level relationship of the insects is unclear. Fossilized insects of enormous size have been found from the Paleozoic Era, including giant dragonflies with wingspans of 55 to 70 cm (22 to 28 in). The most diverse insect groups appear to have coevolved with flowering plants.

                        Adult insects typically move about by walking, flying, or sometimes swimming. As it allows for rapid yet stable movement, many insects adopt a tripedal gait in which they walk with their legs touching the ground in alternating triangles, composed of the front and rear on one side with the middle on the other side. Insects are the only invertebrate group with members able to achieve sustained powered flight, and all flying insects derive from one common ancestor. Many insects spend at least part of their lives under water, with larval adaptations that include gills, and some adult insects are aquatic and have adaptations for swimming. Some species, such as water striders, are capable of walking on the surface of water. Insects are mostly solitary, but some, such as certain bees, ants and termites, are social and live in large, well-organized colonies. Some insects, such as earwigs, show maternal care, guarding their eggs and young. Insects can communicate with each other in a variety of ways. Male moths can sense the pheromones of female moths over great distances. Other species communicate with sounds: crickets stridulate, or rub their wings together, to attract a mate and repel other males. Lampyrid beetles communicate with light.

                        <p>
                            There is a huge group of people that are fascinated with dragonflies. Want to know more about these interested insects? Here is more information about them.    
                        </p>
                        <h3>Dragonflies</h3>
                        <p>
                            “A dragonfly is an insect belonging to the order Odonata, infraorder Anisoptera. Adult dragonflies are characterized by large, multifaceted eyes, two pairs of strong, transparent wings, sometimes with colored patches, and an elongated body. Dragonflies can be mistaken for the related group, damselflies (Zygoptera), which are similar in structure, though usually lighter in build; however, the wings of most dragonflies are held flat and away from the body, while damselflies hold the wings folded at rest, along or above the abdomen. Dragonflies are agile fliers, while damselflies have a weaker, fluttery flight. Many dragonflies have brilliant iridescent or metallic colors produced by structural coloration, making them conspicuous in flight. An adult dragonfly’s compound eyes have nearly 24,000 ommatidia each. Fossils of very large dragonfly ancestors in the Protodonata are found from 325 million years ago (Mya) in Upper Carboniferous rocks; these had wingspans up to about 750 mm (30 in). There are about 3,000 extant species. Most are tropical, with fewer species in temperate regions,” reports Wikipedia.org.

                        <h3>Fastest flying insect</h3>
                        <p>
                            According to Smithsonian, “the fastest flying Insect is the Dragonfly which are known to travel at the speed of 35 miles an hour. Hawk Moths, which have been clocked at a speed of 33.7 miles an hour, come in second. Dragonflies can travel at 100 body-lengths per second in forward flight, and three lengths per second backwards. The dragonfly is the longest distance traveler / flyer in the world. The longest distance that this species can fly is up to 11,000 miles (almost 18,000 kilometers)”. Dragonflies are hunters and they prey on other flying insects. They use their speed and agility to help them catch their meal in midair.

                <H2>What is the largest insect in the world?</H2>
                <p>
                    If you are creeped out by bugs, brace yourself.  Insects can get pretty big, but what is the largest insect in the world? “Largest” is a relative term. A mouse is large to a flea, but not to a giraffe. So there are several different ways of measuring the size of an insect, most people would consider the largest insect to be the bulkiest and in this case the champion insect is the Acteaeom Beetle or Rhinoceros Beetle (Megasoma actaeon) from South Americ. The male beetles can be 9cms long by 5cms wide by 4cms thick…that’s one bulky bug!    
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you want to measure largest by overall size, check out the South American Longhorn Beetle (Titanus giganteus) these giants can be over 16cms in body length (not including antennae).    
                </p>
                <p>
                    One other beetle, the Hercules Beetle, (Dynastes hercules) is also well known for reaching 16cms in length though it is not nearly as heavy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the way, insects are larger in other ways, the longest insect in the world is the Stick-Insect (Pharnacia serritypes), the females of which can be over 36cm long.
