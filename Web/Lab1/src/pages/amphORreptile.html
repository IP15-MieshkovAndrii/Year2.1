            <h3>Golden Poison Frog</h3>
            <p>
                The golden poison frog is considered one of the most toxic animals on Earth. A single specimen measuring two inches has enough venom to kill ten grown men. The indigenous Emberá people of Colombia have used its powerful venom for centuries to tip their blowgun darts when hunting, hence the species' name.    
            </p>
            <h4>Population</h4>
            <p>
                These brightly colored amphibians are among the largest of the more than 100 poison dart frog species, averaging more than one inch in length. They live within a tiny plot of rain forest on the Pacific coast of Colombia. And though the population in its small range is abundant, widespread decimation of the rain forest has landed this species on international endangered lists.
            </p>
            <h4>Coloring and Diet</h4>
            <p>
                Their coloring, which can be yellow, orange, or pale green, depending on their particular range, is deliberately ostentatious to ward off potential predators, a tactic called aposematic coloration. Their diet includes flies, crickets, ants, termites, and beetles.
            </p>
            <h4>Toxicity</h4>
            <p>
                Scientists are unsure of the source of this frog's amazing toxicity, but it is possible they assimilate plant poisons, which are carried by their prey. Poison dart frogs raised in captivity and isolated from insects in their native habitat never develop venom.
            </p>
            <p>
                The medical research community has been exploring possible medicinal uses for the golden poison frog's toxins. They have already developed a synthetic version of one of the poison's compounds that has promise as a powerful painkiller.

                    <H2>Amphibian or Reptile? Here's the Difference</H2>
                    <p>
                        Amphibians and reptiles might seem similar—low to the ground, often in water, and not warm or fuzzy—but these two distinct groups exhibit striking differences in the three Bs: body, breeding and behavior.    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, let’s get how they are alike out of the way: Amphibians and reptiles are vertebrates—animals with backbones. The majority of species have four legs, but there are a lot of exceptions in both groups. They derive their body heat from their environment rather than from a high metabolism. You’ll find amphibians and reptiles on every continent except Antarctica, but only reptiles have seagoing species.    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Which brings us to one major difference that will tell you right away if that long, legless animal you’re looking at is a snake or a caecilian: Skin.    
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Reptiles hatch from eggs that have a protective outer layer such as a brittle or leathery shell. Hatchlings are usually miniature versions of an adult, ready to take off in the world. Amphibians lay jellylike eggs that you can see through, and the hatchlings typically look nothing like the adult. Most amphibians undergo metamorphosis, during which they change from an aquatic animal that breathes through gills to an adult that may have gills or lungs, depending on the species.

                    <p>
                        Amphibians can also breathe through their moist, porous skin, and, in fact, several salamander species and one kind of frog have neither gills nor lungs: They get all of their oxygen through their skin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because amphibians can breathe through their skin, they are extremely susceptible to toxins in the environment, especially in water. The presence or absence of amphibians in a pond or stream is an excellent indicator of its water quality. Reptiles’ impermeable scales protect them from many pollutants and other toxins in water, on land and even in the air that an amphibian could absorb and be affected by. That’s also why reptiles can live in salt water and amphibians can’t.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, here’s a way to tell the difference by ear: Reptiles hiss, grunt and even roar, but amphibians make spring nights magical with their chorus of mating calls in a pond or wetland.

                        <H2>The Most Dangerous Reptile</H2>
                        <p>
                            All animals attract attention for various reasons, their physical appearance being perhaps the most common. It is a primal response we use as a way to protect ourselves and know who is friend or foe. Reptiles are one of the most feared in the animal kingdom as they encompass some of the deadliest creatures on the planet. This is why even harmless reptiles we keep as pets induce a certain amount of fear in many people. With crocodiles and their powerful jaws or poisonous snakes and their deadly venom, it is understandable why some may be wary.    
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The King Cobra has a powerful venom which is used to paralyze its prey before ingesting it. It is one of the most poisonous snakes in the world, its venom being complex and having a very fast cardiotoxic and neurotoxic action. This means that once its prey has been dosed, it will directly affect the heart and central nervous system. The recipient is first paralyzed, followed by a steady shutting down of all bodily functions.

                            King cobras are native to Southeast Asia, India and Southern China. Its thin body can exceed 5 meters in length and is considered the largest of the poisonous snakes. To distinguish from other snake species, we can see they have a a hood which extends when they are in a defensive position. They also have two large ‘occipitals’ which are large individual scales on the back of their head. Only the King Cobra has this particular type of scale pattern.

                <H2>Largest Reptile in the World</H2>
                <p>
                    The saltwater crocodile is the largest of all the crocodile species and is the largest reptile in the world. On average, saltwater crocodiles are the largest crocodilian species, but sizes will vary. A crocodile’s size can vary due to sex, living conditions, species, and the types of food available to them.     
                </p>
                <p>
                    Males are the largest saltwater crocodiles and regularly grow around 20 to 21 feet (6 to 6.3 meters).  The biggest saltwater crocodile ever recorded was Lolong, who measured 20.3 feet (6.17 meters) and weighed 2,370 lbs (1,075 kg).     
                </p>
                <p>
                    Saltwater crocodiles are the largest crocodile, but other species can occasionally get close to the size of this monster. This species lives in Southeast Asia, eastern India, and parts of Australia. They inhabit freshwaters and get their name from their ability to swim in and tolerate salt and brackish waters. Being the largest reptile in the world, they are also one of the world’s fiercest predators.
